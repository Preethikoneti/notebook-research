The interactive notebook can't be used without cloning the repository and accessing the whole dataset. The PDFs here are to get an idea of what can be done in this notebook and explore some interesting subsets! IPython widgets can't be rendered in PDF versions of notebooks, so the cell producing the interactive widgets is commented out in these documents.
