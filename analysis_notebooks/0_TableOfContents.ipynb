    "## Project Description\n",
    "As an extension of work done by [Rule et al.](https://blog.jupyter.org/we-analyzed-1-million-jupyter-notebooks-now-you-can-too-guest-post-8116a964b536) in 2017, the goal of this project is to collect and analyze all public Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub ([~1 million in 2017](https://library.ucsd.edu/dc/collection/bb6931851t), [now nearly 5 million](https://github.com/parente/nbestimate/blob/master/estimate.ipynb)). This analysis will help designers, developers, and researchers in the Jupyter community quantitatively assess how people use notebooks, with an emphasis on applications in data science, machine learning, and information visualization. This GitHub repository holds the scripts used to search, download, and process notebooks from GitHub, and the set of notebooks used to analyze the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this research can complement qualitative user studies and inform challenging UX questions to focus development on real user needs. This understanding of notebook applications is crucial to user-centered design. Because many of the notebooks hosted publicly on GitHub are created as part of educational endeavours such as online and in-person courses, these insights may be particularly valuable for the Jupyter education community."
